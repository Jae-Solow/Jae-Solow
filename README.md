**Jae-Solow/Jae-Solow** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on: learning to prgram in C++
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: C++, Swift, and Python
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on: Anything small to get my feet wet and to gain a little knowledge and see how collaboration works.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: I'm not going to lie, C++ is giving me a run for my money right now. I would say just anything anyone can offer, maybe some tips or tricks that they have learned along the way to make life easier.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about: I'm a very solid networker, so I have a few people waiting on me to gain knowledge so they can have me do work for them. I am not opposed to pulling someone in on a project, if it means a win-win for both parties.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: email would probably be the quickest, JMEllis1@student.fullsail.edu, or jamessmith@freemindset.org
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love to learn new things!
